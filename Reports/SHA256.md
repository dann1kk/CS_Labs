# SHA256 Hash Function

## Theory
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;  SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and first published in 2001.[3][4] They are built using the Merkle–Damgård construction, from a one-way compression function itself built using the Davies–Meyer structure from a specialized block cipher.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;  SHA-256 and SHA-512 are novel hash functions computed with eight 32-bit and 64-bit words, respectively. They use different shift amounts and additive constants, but their structures are otherwise virtually identical, differing only in the number of rounds.

## Implementation 
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; This is an implementation of SHA256 which includes the basic steps: 
1. Pre-processing of the original message
2. Break and process the message in block of 512 bits
    1. Divide each block into 16 words 32 bits long
    2. Generate additional 48 words
    3. Initialize auxiliary variables and set them equal to the current hash values respectively. h0, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7
    4. Perform the compression loop
    5. After the compression loop, we modify the hash values by adding their respective variables to them, a-h. As usual, all addition is modulo 2^32.

### Main Steps: 
1. Pre-process the original message 
```
 m_len = len(message)
    p_len = 64 - m_len % 64 - 8
    m = message + (0b10000000).to_bytes(p_len, byteorder='little', signed=False) + (m_len * 8).to_bytes(8, byteorder='big', signed=False)
```
2. After splitting the message in 512 bits block and initializing auxiliary variables, we run the main loop which will mutate the values of a...h
```
  for i in range(64):
            S0 = ror(a,2,32) ^ ror(a,13,32) ^ ror(a,22,32)
            S1 = ror(e,6,32) ^ ror(e,11,32) ^ ror(e,25,32)
            Ch = (e & f) ^ ((~e) & g)
            Ma = (a & b) ^ (a & c) ^ (b & c)
            t1 = (h + S1 + Ch + k[i] + w[i]) % MOD32
            t2 = (S0 + Ma) % MOD32
            h = g
            g = f
            f = e
            e = (d + t1) % MOD32
            d = c
            c = b
            b = a
            a = (t1 + t2) % MOD32
```
3. Final step just adding the obtained values, with modulo 32 
```
        h0 = (h0 + a) % MOD32
        h1 = (h1 + b) % MOD32
        h2 = (h2 + c) % MOD32
        h3 = (h3 + d) % MOD32
        h4 = (h4 + e) % MOD32
        h5 = (h5 + f) % MOD32
        h6 = (h6 + g) % MOD32
        h7 = (h7 + h) % MOD32
```
