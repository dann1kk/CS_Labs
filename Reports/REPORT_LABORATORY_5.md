## Theory
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Authentication & authorization are 2 of the main security goals of IT systems and should not be used interchangibly. Simply put, during authentication the system verifies the identity of a user or service, and during authorization the system checks the access rights, optionally based on a given user role.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; There are multiple types of authentication based on the implementation mechanism or the data provided by the user. Some usual ones would be the following:
- Based on credentials (Username/Password);
- Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA, MFA);
- Based on digital certificates;
- Based on biometrics;
- Based on tokens.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Regarding authorization, the most popular mechanisms are the following:
- Role Based Access Control (RBAC): Base on the role of a user;
- Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC): Based on a characteristic/attribute of a user.

## Objectives:
1. Take what you have at the moment from previous laboratory works and put it in a web service / serveral web services.
2. Your services should have implemented basic authentication and MFA (the authentication factors of your choice).
3. Your web app needs to simulate user authorization and the way you authorise user is also a choice that needs to be done by you.
4. As services that your application could provide, you could use the classical ciphers. Basically the user would like to get access and use the classical ciphers, but they need to authenticate and be authorized. 

## Implementations
1. [TOTP Authenticator (2FA) and Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://github.com/dann1kk/CS_Labs/blob/main/Reports/2FA.md)
